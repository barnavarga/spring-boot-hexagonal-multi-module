# Hexagonal Architecture Example

## Inspiration
Hexagonal Architecture inspired the idea of the creation of this project where the focus is on the Hexagonal Architecture demonstration. 
In many cases, the examples are being placed in complex circumstances: various kinds of databases or services. Therefore, the aim of this project is to give a domain logic-rich application.

This project tries to sure that this architecture is worth using in a complex domain logic environment in a microservice for example.
There is the fact that the Hexagonal Architecture may not be recommended for CRUD applications because it would have not a marginal overhead due to the number of extra classes.
